# city-explorer-api


**Author**: David Whitmore
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
This is the API for a city explorer app. At this point it will only pull weather data for a specific city that it is given.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
2. run npm i to get the node modules
3. You will also need to add a .env file with specified port access to 3333 for this code to run properly. 

## Architecture
This was built with Javascript using Node and Express.

## Change Log
07-20-2001 8:00pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource.

## Credit and Collaborations
Thank you to the Code Fellows TA's for helping me trouble shoot!
